# Properties of OOPS
"These Two Protects the Data"
            # Abstraction 
            # Encapsulation 
"These Two used for Code Reusablity "
            # Inheritance
            # Polymorhpism



#  Vaiables types 
" static , class and local varibale "
#  Methods
" Constructor , intence , static , class method "
